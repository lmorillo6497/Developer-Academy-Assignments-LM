story_script = f"On {user_weekday}, I went to {user_location}. Things got off to a bad start when I was {vehicle_prep} the {user_vehicle}. I don't know where it came from, but I was bitten by {animal_art} {user_animal}. The creature immediately developed a taste for my blood, and all I could do to save myself and sate its hunger was to throw it my {user_food}. I shouldn't complain, because doing so saved me from mortal peril, but it did mean that I had no lunch. As soon as I reached {user_location} I had to dash to {user_shop} in search of more {user_food} - but they were cleared out! I had to settle for some {user_noun}, which I found rather difficult to chew.\nFeeling {user_mood}, I opted to do some sightseeing. I can't say that I was particularly impressed by {user_location}'s selection of tourism hotspots. I spent £{user_number} on a ticket for the {user_location} Museum of {user_noun_2}. What a rip-off! I decided to cut my losses and head home."
